# RNAseq_deltaCPS1_Narra2016

Practice RNA seq analysis by re-analyzing the RNA seq data from Narra et al 2016 to find differentially expressed genes between Coccidioides posadasii Silveira WT and CPS1.

About data:
"RNA-seq was performed, in duplicate, on the C. posadasii and cps1 strain RNAs by 100-bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq2000 at the University of Arizona Genetics Core facility. Sequencing produced between 2.05 x 10^7 and 2.37 x 10^7 paired-end reads per library (Narra et al 2016)."
