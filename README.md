# RNAseq_from_CPS1_Narra2016

Re-analyze the RNA seq data from Narra et al 2016 to find differentially expressed genes between Coccidioides posadasii Silveira WT and CPS1.
This is to practice RNA seq analysis for future experiments and get a feel for how much read depth we need.

About data (from Narra et al 20016)
"RNA-seq was performed, in duplicate, on the C. posadasii and cps1 strain RNAs by 100-bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq2000 at the University of Arizona Genetics Core facility. Sequencing produced between 2.05*10^7 and 2.37*10^7 paired-end reads per library."
